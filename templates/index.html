          <p>Inception and Vision</p>
          S.U.R.E. (Serving Under Resourced Education) was established with a mission to uplift minority students in underserved communities. Founders Mahid Shams, Ezequiel Martinez, Elmary Rodriguez, and Martina Adogli are all students residing in New York City, and coming from public and charter schools recognized the lack of resources available to students. Now attending private schools, they were able to gain connections with others, and build their network. Being able to begin their networking journey allowed them to recognize the privilege they have, but they have access to resources that should be available to all students, despite what schools they attend. They wanted a way for their users to gain and grow their network through educational resources and networking opportunities. As the organization grew, it became evident that a strong online presence was crucial to reach and support more students effectively. The idea of developing a website emerged as a natural step in amplifying S.U.R.E.'s impact.
          
          <p>Planning and Design</p>
          In the early stages, the S.U.R.E. founders began to outline the objectives of their website. They envisioned a simple and user-friendly platform that would not only provide information about their programs such as mentoring and how to get access to those mentors, but also facilitate interactive engagement through features like AI chatbots and resource databases. The design had to reflect the organization's commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, with their site being accessible in different languages.
          
          
          <p>Ongoing Evolution</p>
          As S.U.R.E. continues to grow and evolve, the website remains a dynamic part of their strategy. Regular updates and enhancements are made to ensure that the site meets the changing needs of the community it serves. The goal is to keep expanding the features and resources available, further strengthening the support system for minority students.
